# LanguageTranslator_using_IBM-Watson

LanguageTranslator is a python program that enables you to translate text from and to some popular languages.

You would require an IBM cloud account for getting access to the LanguageTranslator API from IBM Watson. Also, you may get an instance of the API for yourself, of which, the credentials would be used in the python script.

To run the script without any glitches, consider the requirements.txt file (at https://github.com/dishantvyas15/LanguageTranslator_using_IBM-Watson/blob/master/requirements.txt) and make sure you have all the required libraries installed on your (virtual) environment.

Used Packages: ibm_watson wget, pandas
